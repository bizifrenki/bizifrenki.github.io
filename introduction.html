      <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I grew up in Raleigh, graduated from WTCC, then transferred to UNCC last year. I grew up loving art: music, drawing, dancing, and acting. In fact, I wanted to make a career out of one of these. But as I grew older, the love for technology took over, and that’s what I spend most of my free time looking into.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I’m currently taking all of my classes online for flexibility, as I am in the process of starting up healthcare and transportation companies. I worked at Amazon for almost 3 years.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m a full-time junior student majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS) and minoring in Operations & Supply Mgmt.</li>
      <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I’ve been learning SQL and Python, and these two relate to the class as they’re computer languages.</li>
      <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> MacOS on a MacBook Pro and Windows 11 on a gaming PC.</li>
      <li><strong>Courses I’m in & Why:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>ITSC1110 - Computer Science Principles - Elective, but also because I love to know the foundations of anything I love!</li>
          <li>HLTH2101 - Healthy Lifestyles - Elective, but also because I want to live a healthy life.</li>
          <li>RELS1502 - World Religions - Honestly, because it’s an elective!</li>
          <li>SOCY1101 - Intro Sociology - Just because I had to pick an elective.</li>
          <li>GEOL1200 - Physical Geology - I’m a geography nerd, so taking a geology elective was a no-brainer!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item About Me:</strong> I can speak and write three languages natively: English, Swahili, and Kirundi. I can also speak and write French, not fluently, but I can hold conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>I’d also like to Share:</strong> I can draw and play guitar and piano.</li>
